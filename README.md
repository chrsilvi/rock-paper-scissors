# rock-paper-scissors

Simple Python game to play rock, paper, scissors with the computer.
The computer will randomly select between four behavioral patters. It will either select randomly, copy your last move, 
select each next move in subsequent order, or it will play more competitively. The more competitive version remembers the last
round. If it won, it will repeat that move, and if it lost, it will next play the move that would have won.
